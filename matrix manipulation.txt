Ruby has a built-in Matrix class in its standard library that provides various methods for matrix manipulation. 
Here are some examples of matrix manipulation in Ruby:

Creating a matrix:
require 'matrix'

matrix = Matrix[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
Accessing elements in a matrix:

element = matrix[0, 1]  # 2
row = matrix.row(1)  # Vector[4, 5, 6]
column = matrix.column(2)  # Vector[3, 6, 9]

Performing arithmetic operations on matrices:
matrix1 = Matrix[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
matrix2 = Matrix[[5, 6], [7, 8]]

sum = matrix1 + matrix2
difference = matrix1 - matrix2
product = matrix1 * matrix2

Transposing a matrix:
transpose = matrix.transpose

Determinant and inverse of a matrix:
determinant = matrix.det
inverse = matrix.inverse
