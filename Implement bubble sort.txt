The bubble_sort method takes one argument: an array arr to be sorted. 
It uses nested loops to compare adjacent pairs of elements in the array and swap them if they are in the wrong order. 
The outer loop runs n-1 times, where n is the length of the array, since each pass of the loop "bubbles up" the largest unsorted element 
to the end of the array.

The inner loop runs from the first element to the n-i-2th element, 
since after each pass the last i elements of the array are guaranteed to be sorted. Within the inner loop,
 it compares the current element with the next element and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

After the loops have finished running, the method returns the sorted array.
