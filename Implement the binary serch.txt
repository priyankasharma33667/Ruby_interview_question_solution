The binary_search method takes two arguments: an array arr and a target value to search for. 
It uses a while loop to repeatedly narrow down the search range by comparing the middle element of the range to the target value
 and adjusting the range accordingly. If the target value is found in the array, the method returns its index; otherwise, 
it returns -1 to indicate that the target value was not found.
