def linear_search(arr, target)
  arr.each_with_index do |item, index|
    if item == target
      return index
    end
  end
  return -1
end



The linear_search method takes two arguments: an array arr and a target value to search for. 
It iterates through each element in the array using the each_with_index method,
 and checks whether the current element matches the target value. 
If it finds a match, it returns the index of the element in the array.
 If it searches through the entire array and doesn't find a match, it returns -1 to indicate that the target value was not found.
