# Example series of numbers
series = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Calculate the sum of the series of numbers using the arithmetic sum formula
n = series.length + 1
expected_sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2

# Calculate the actual sum of the numbers in the series
actual_sum = series.sum

# The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum
missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum

puts missing_number  # Output: 5
